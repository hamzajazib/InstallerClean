// check-translation-freshness.mjs: fail when a satellite is still carrying a
// translation of a SUPERSEDED English value.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHY NOTHING ELSE CATCHES IT. The other gates on the
// satellites do not ask whether a translation is out of date.
// check-still-english.mjs fires when a satellite value EQUALS the current
// neutral, check-superseded-english.mjs when it equals a FORMER one,
// check-resx-parity.mjs compares key presence and NUMERIC placeholder arity, and
// check-cross-key-rules.mjs enforces named-token and heading rules. A satellite
// holding a TRANSLATION of the previous English of a key whose neutral has since
// been rewritten equals nothing any of them compares it against: the key is
// present, the arity usually matches, and the value is neither the current
// English nor a former one. It passes all of them silently, in every language.
//
// flag-retranslation.mjs is what sets a key's translations back to the English once
// its English has moved, and it acts only when somebody runs it. This is the
// enforcement, asking on every push rather than when somebody remembers.
//
// WHAT A PASS DOES NOT SAY. Which neutral value a given translation was actually
// made from is not recorded anywhere: a generator MAP entry is 'Key': `translation`
// and carries no source English. So this check compares against a LEDGER of what
// was true when each entry was last recorded, and it can only speak about drift
// from that moment forward. It makes NO claim about any translation predating its
// own seed. A key seeded "unverified" is reported as unverified and is not a pass.
//
// DO NOT REPLACE THIS WITH A DATE COMPARISON. The date version of this check asks
// whether a satellite's value last moved before the neutral's did, and the English
// moves for reasons that leave a translation correct. It flags Status.Ready in
// Spanish and Russian, where the neutral says "Ready" and the satellites say
// "Listo" and "Готово", which are correct; flagging destroys two good
// translations for a human to redo. It flags the two Cli.Help lines where the only
// thing that moved was column padding that check-cli-help-alignment.mjs already
// owns. A date is a screen for a human to read, never a gate. flag-retranslation.mjs
// replaces a translation with the English, and a run that writes prints its own way
// back when it finishes.
//
// THE PARSE CONTROL IN readResx IS NOT DEFENSIVE PROGRAMMING AND MUST NOT BE
// SIMPLIFIED INTO A WARNING. This file's regex wants <value> on the same
// whitespace run as <data>, so anything else landing between them drops that
// entry silently: a <comment> moved above its <value> is valid resx, is what the
// Visual Studio editor emits, and costs that entry. A silent zero over an
// incomplete set reads exactly like a clean result, so refusing with exit 2 is
// the correct answer.
//
// IT HAS TWO LEGS AND BOTH ARE LOAD-BEARING. `out.size !== raw` catches a file
// the regex read only part of; `raw === 0` catches one it found no entries in at
// all, which the first cannot see, both of its counts being zero. Neither figure
// is written down, so adding a string cannot make either go stale.
//
// AND THE LEDGER IS TRACKED, IN THE REPOSITORY, DELIBERATELY. A gate reads what
// CI checks out, so the ledger has to sit where CI can read it. Anything kept
// outside the repository can be a working record and can never be a gate. Do not
// move this file out of it.
//
// Usage (from the repo root):
//   node scripts/check-translation-freshness.mjs            check, exit 1 on a stale,
//                                                           GONE or ORPHANED entry
//   node scripts/check-translation-freshness.mjs --record <Key> [<Key> ...]
//                                                           stamp keys as translated now
//   node scripts/check-translation-freshness.mjs --record-unverified <Key> [<Key> ...]
//                                                           stamp keys as never established
