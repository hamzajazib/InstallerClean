// claim nobody has made rather than a translation, so the ledger has no answer for
// it and the value comparison is the only thing that can hold it.

// Rule 6. The installer-folder token survives translation.
//
// Every string that names the installer cache folder writes {InstallerFolder}
// and Strings.Get substitutes the resolved path, so a machine whose Windows

// renders the token into their own language, or drops it, gets a sentence with
// a hole in it. check-resx-parity cannot see this: it matches {N} only.

// A sentence that carries a link holds it as a phrase inside itself rather than
// as a line of its own. The resx marks the phrase with [square brackets] and
// CompositionParsing.SplitAtBracketedPhrase turns the pair into a Hyperlink as
// the window is built. A value with no pair renders as plain prose, which is the
// right fallback and is also completely silent: a translator who drops the
// brackets takes a link off a screen and nothing anywhere says so.
//
// Which keys carry a pair is the neutral's decision, as with rule 6, so there
// is no list here to go stale as screens gain and lose links. Both directions
// are faulted: a satellite that has LOST its pair silently drops a link, and
// one that has GAINED brackets on a key nothing splits paints the brackets.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Rule 7. A window title resolved in XAML is never written in code.
//
// Every dialog here is ShowInTaskbar=False under custom chrome, so Title is
// never painted and exists only for the announcement a screen reader makes when
// the window opens. A window takes its title from one key in XAML or composes it
// in code (the heading and the question, not a category), never both. A write in
// code replaces the value the XAML resolved, and one made before the window shows
// leaves the key referenced and never read, which check-dead-resx-keys does not
// report.
//
// A write is an assignment by any operator, a SetValue, SetCurrentValue,
// SetBinding or ClearValue on TitleProperty, the same through BindingOperations,
// or a Title set in an object initializer. A receiver typed as Window can hold any
// window, so a write through one counts against every window whose XAML resolves
// Title, as does one on an object made by new() with no type written. A Title not
// read as a declaration or as another object's member is a write.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Rule 8. A resx value reaches a user through Strings and nothing else.
//
// Strings.Get and Strings.Find substitute rule 6's token on the way out.
// ResourceManager answers any key by name, and a read that goes round the two
// doors hands a user a literal {InstallerFolder} on screen, in a console or through
// a screen reader. A satellite-only plural override has no typed accessor, and
// Strings.Find is its door.
//
// The two doors are internal to the Core assembly and so is the manager behind
// them, and every project in the solution holds InternalsVisibleTo, so a compiler
