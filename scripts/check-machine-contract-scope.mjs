// check-machine-contract-scope.mjs: fails where a test composes an Application-channel
// value outside the en-GB scope its write site builds it in.
//
// The command line's Application-log entries are read by machines, so they are built
// in en-GB whatever the PC's language: every write site passes a lambda to
// MachineContract.English or MachineContract.WriteEventLog, which applies the scope
// itself. A test that builds one of these values outside that scope gets it in the
// language the test runs in rather than the en-GB value the channel carries.
//
// What is read: every .cs file in the test project, through csharp-source.mjs, with the
// comments and the text inside strings taken out, so every match is code. What is
// matched: a call to any method in BUILDERS, and any Strings.Cli_EventLog* value. What
// is in scope: anything inside the argument list of a MachineContract.English or
// MachineContract.WriteEventLog call, found by balancing its brackets, since the call
// sites here wrap across lines.
//
// The production code is not read. The builders' own bodies read these values outside
// any scope, being what each write site wraps.
//
// Every reference is printed with its file, line and what it names, in scope or not.
// Exit 1 where one is out of scope. Exit 2 where a file cannot be read to its end, a
// scope call's argument list does not close, or fewer than 12 references are found.
//
// Usage (from the repo root):
//   node scripts/check-machine-contract-scope.mjs
