    /// offered only where the per-product condition positively established that nothing
    /// on any product sharing it could be uninstalled and roll back onto its file. The
    /// offer rests on that fact about other patches, and a re-verify that does not
    /// re-check the fact the offer rests on is not a re-verify.

    /// THE SECOND HALF IS KEYED READS AND NEVER AN ENUMERATION, which is what makes it
    /// affordable with the machine-wide lease held. The pre-lease pass has already
    /// worked out which pairings to look at, so this asks about records by name, and
    /// every answer is about the record named rather than about the machine, which is
    /// the property an enumeration cannot offer.
    ///
    /// A KEYED READ COMES BACK IN FOUR SHAPES. They are a value, a positive "there is
    /// no such record", a read that failed, and an answer that came back empty without
    /// having failed. The batch's own pairings tell the first three apart. An empty
    /// answer there counts with the reads that failed where the verdict turns on it, an
    /// empty State or an empty Uninstallable beside a superseded State, and beside an
    /// applied or obsoleted State it is a claim, which is how the scan reads the patch's
    /// own row. The sibling reads tell two. A read that failed, an answer that
    /// there is no such record and an empty answer are an inability, which is how the
    /// scan's reading of a product's patch set takes each of them, and a value that is
    /// present and not zero is a live claim on the rollback. Only a clean value lets a
    /// path through, a removable reading for the batch's own pairings and a zero for a
    /// sibling, so what the other shapes decide between is the cause counted for the
    /// path and not whether it is held back.
    ///
    /// THE SET IT RE-READS IS WHAT THE PRE-LEASE ENUMERATION FOUND HOLDING EACH PATCH.
    /// The batch's pairings are its claims on a surviving path, and each installation
    /// that, asked by name, answered that it holds a surviving patch where no claim
    /// recorded it. The siblings are the other claims on the products those name, and,
    /// for an installation found by asking that holds no claim at all, every patch
    /// Windows listed for it. A registration neither found is not re-read here: a patch
    /// on a product holding none of the batch's own, a patch past the end of a list
    /// that did not run to its end, and anything registered after the enumeration.
    ///
    /// SO THIS IS NOT THE SCAN'S OWN CONDITION RE-RUN UNDER THE LEASE, and nothing may
    /// describe it as one. That condition asks every product any of its sources names,
    /// against each product's registered patch set as the registry lists it and
    /// worsened by what the enumeration read. This puts the same two questions about a
    /// bounded set of records.
    ///
    /// THE PRE-LEASE PASS IS THE WIDER CHECK. It re-runs the whole enumeration moments
    /// earlier and applies that condition at its full width, and a path it condemns
    /// never arrives here at all. What it cannot do is run again inside the hold, and
    /// that is what this adds: the same two questions, put about a bounded set of
    /// records, in the window its own enumeration leaves open.
    ///
    /// DO NOT NARROW THIS BACK TO THE BATCH'S OWN PAIRINGS. That re-asks half the rule
