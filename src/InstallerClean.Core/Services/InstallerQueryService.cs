        // What it does: a scan with a claim it cannot place withholds the whole

        // assertion for any patch on the machine, a patch being cached once and shared
        // across the products that hold it.
        //
        // A PRODUCT WHOSE RECORDS CAME BACK SHORT FIRES IT ONLY WHERE THE REGISTRY DOES
        // NOT HOLD WHAT ITS FAILED READS WOULD HAVE RETURNED, under that installation's
        // own account (RegistryHoldsWhatWasLost). A failed patch row names its product
        // and not its patch (the API documents its output buffers for ERROR_SUCCESS and
        // ERROR_MORE_DATA only, and the loop clears the buffer per iteration), and a
        // failed LocalPackage read names its product but not the path it would have
        // claimed. So neither says which file the lost claim was on, and where the
        // registry does not hold the record either, nothing does. Where it does, the
        // fallback has claimed that record's path, WithholdOnRegistryPackageRecords reads
        // it against every superseded patch, and the product itself is asked by each
        // superseded patch's code: the per-pairing pass asks whether it holds the patch
        // still needed, and the judging pass puts it into the patch's product set
        // wherever it answers that it holds the patch at all.
        //
        // A RECORDED PATH THE SCAN COULD NOT SETTLE WITHHOLDS THE CLASS AS WELL, for
        // the reason it withholds the walk-derived offer: nothing says which file the
        // claim it came from names. Claims meet on a row by their normalised path, so
        // a claim kept in a spelling nothing resolves need not land on the row for the
        // file it means, and where it does not, the claim never reaches that row. That
        // claim can be a second registration of a superseded patch, holding it applied
        // under another product, or any other registration aimed at the patch's file.
        // The per-pairing pass asks every installation it knows of about the patch
        // itself, so a second registration of that patch, held by an installation the
        // scan listed, is answered there wherever its claim landed. A registration of
        // anything else aimed at the file, another patch's or a product's own package,
        // reaches the file only by landing on its row: the per-pairing pass asks about
        // this patch and the per-product condition about patch sets. The claim names a
        // file the scan cannot place, so it can be any of them, and scan-wide is again
        // the finest granularity there is.
        //
        // IT IS ASKED THROUGH EnumerationCensus.AnyRecordedPathUnestablished, the
        // property the walk-derived withholding asks, so a population added to the
        // census reaches both halves of the offer. A row it withholds carries
        // WithheldOnRecordedPathUnestablished, whether or not the unaccounted-products
        // condition held too, and the opt-in report counts those rows.
        //
        // This loop moves only the removable class, the superseded patches, and only
        // on a scan that could not settle a product, found a cached patch file no
        // product it asks is recorded as holding, or could not settle a recorded path.
        // The walk half is decided elsewhere, on conditions of its own, the last of
        // these among them.
        //
        // AND IT TOUCHES NOTHING ELSE, WHICH IS A DECISION RATHER THAN THE ABSENCE OF
        // ONE. A second arm here, clearing the unread-file marker on a row something
        // else has already withheld so that the missing-files split treats such a row
        // as unaccounted for, is not wanted and must not be added under any name.
        //
        // WHAT THE MARKER MEANS IS WHY. It records that the ONLY reason the row lost
        // its verdict was that the pass reading the patch file could not read it, and
        // the split reads it for one population: rows whose file has GONE. For those
        // the failed read is the read of the very file whose absence is the subject.
        // Nobody can perform it, on any machine, ever, and it fails identically
        // whatever removed the file. Clearing it would make that tautology a reason to
        // warn, and a run that came up short somewhere ELSE would print an alarm about
        // a file this scan had positively established nothing could reach for.
        //
        // AND THE CONDITIONS THIS LOOP FIRES ON DO NOT NAME THAT ROW'S RISK. They are a
        // product the enumeration DID return whose lost records the registry does not
        // hold, a product it returned whose installations the keyed ask did not settle
        // and whose registry entry names a cached file the enumeration never claimed that
        // is on the disk, a product the registry names that this scan could not settle,
        // and a cached patch file no product the scan asks is recorded as holding. None
        // of them is "a holder of this patch went unseen", which is the condition that
        // would bear on this file. They are signs of a degraded machine, not a per-file
        // verdict.
        //
        // A RECORDED PATH THE SCAN COULD NOT SETTLE CAN BE THAT HOLDER, and the split
        // still needs nothing from this loop, because the holder's registration reaches
        // the split through the row it lands on. Where the superseded file has gone, the
        // registration kept in the unsettled spelling names that same absent file, or
        // names nothing, so its row reads missing as well, and the split reports a
        // missing row that is not a superseded or obsoleted patch whatever its verdict.
        // The warning names that holder's program through that row.
        //
        // THE WITHHOLDING ITSELF IS WHAT ANSWERS FOR SUCH A MACHINE: a run that could
        // not settle a product, attribute a cached patch file or settle a recorded path
        // offers no superseded patch at all. A file already gone is not kept by printing a
        // sentence about it.
        //
        // A WITHHELD ROW WITH NO MARKER IS REPORTED BY THE SPLIT WHERE ITS FILE HAS
        // GONE. Every row this loop withholds is one. So is every removable path on a
        // run whose machine-wide patch enumeration did not answer, which downgrades
        // them with no marker set (see ConfirmRemovableAgainstEveryProduct), that run
