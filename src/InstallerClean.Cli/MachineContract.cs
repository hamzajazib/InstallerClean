/// Builds the CLI's machine-read output in English whatever the OS UI culture.
/// Two consumers match InstallerClean's output on exact English phrases
/// regardless of the machine's language: RMM tooling greps the Application
/// event-log entries, and scripts match the "\d+ errors:" stdout header, whose
/// always-plural shape is held for exactly that (the emit site carries the
/// reasoning, and what is and is not published about it). Those lines are built
/// through here; everything else the operator reads follows the ambient (OS)
/// culture and is localised.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The mechanism is a thread-culture swap, and it is load-bearing that it
/// reaches the whole line, not just the resx template. A summary interpolates a
/// pluralised noun (<see cref="DisplayHelpers.PluraliseError"/>) and a size
/// (<see cref="DisplayHelpers.FormatSizeForMachine"/>, which carries no group
/// separator and no unit above gigabytes); the template resolves through
/// <see cref="Localisation.UiCulture"/>, the noun through the same, the size
/// through <see cref="Localisation.FormatCulture"/>. Both of those fall through
/// to the thread's <see cref="CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture"/> /
/// <see cref="CultureInfo.CurrentCulture"/> only while no override is set
/// (Localisation.cs), and the CLI never calls <see cref="Localisation.Set"/>, so
/// swapping the two thread cultures forces the template, the noun and the size
/// to en-GB together. A "3,2 GB" size or an "errori" noun reaching the audit
/// line is the failure this prevents.
///
/// A future --lang override would break that. <see cref="Localisation.Set"/>
/// pins UiCultureOverride/FormatCultureOverride ABOVE the thread culture, so the
/// swap below would no longer reach the template, noun or size, only the raw
/// interpolated integers, and the machine line would render in the chosen
/// language. Such a flag has to force <see cref="Localisation"/> back to en-GB
/// for the machine build too, not only the thread culture.

    /// either the scan could not establish which cached files belong to the programs
    /// installed here and offered nothing it walked, or it could not establish that
    /// particular files it found are unneeded. 3003: superseded files were held back,
    /// with their count, whatever the reason and whether or not anything was offered
    /// beside them. 3004: the scan, or the check made before a Move or Delete, stopped
    /// waiting for drives or shares while files still had to be checked against them and
    /// left those files alone; the entry names them, says which of the two it was, and
    /// counts the files, so a run whose scan and check each gave one up writes two. The
    /// check's is written as soon as the check returns, so a run refused after it
    /// carries it too. A notice never replaces the summary and never stands
    /// in for one, so counting runs means counting the summary bands, and each
    /// repeats for as long as its own condition holds, so a machine can emit one on
    /// every run for weeks.

    /// "NEVER THE RUN'S OUTCOME" IS ABOUT COUNTING RUNS AND IS NOT THE OTHER SENSE
    /// OF THE SAME WORDS. <see cref="CliContract.EntryTypeFor"/> separates a
    /// standing property of the machine from a run that fell short of its job, and
    /// on that question 3001 is the standing property while 3000, 3002, 3003 and 3004
    /// are about the run, which is why 3001 is Information and the other four are
    /// Warning.
    /// Nothing here contradicts that: this paragraph says only that a notice is not
    /// the run's SUMMARY entry, which is what a consumer counting runs is asking.
    /// Two questions, near-identical wording, and the sense that travels between
    /// them is the one that would put two Event IDs on the wrong side of an
    /// entry-type decision.
    ///
    /// NOTHING WITHHOLDS AN OBSOLETED REGISTRATION, because none is ever offered on
