/// Standard output for the whole run. Every write goes to the writer the console gave the
/// run, and a write that fails, such as one to an output redirected to a disk that is full,
/// loses what it was writing and nothing more: the next write is tried as if none had
/// failed, and goes through once the disk has room, which a Delete on that disk can give it.
/// Nothing the run prints can throw, so its Application-log entry and its exit code describe
/// what the run did whatever became of its output. A Delete that deleted files is logged and
/// exits as that Delete, and a run refused for something that clears by itself keeps the
/// code that tells a scheduler to come back.
///
/// The first failure is recorded in crash.log and the later ones are not. One cause, such
/// as a full disk, can refuse many writes in a row, and an entry each would spend
/// crash.log's rotation on copies of it.
///
/// A FAILED WRITE CAN STOP PART-WAY THROUGH A LINE. The console's writer sends a line longer
/// than its buffer out in pieces, so the pieces ahead of the failure are out and the rest of
/// the line, its line break included, is not. So after a failure the guard puts a line break
/// ahead of the next write, tried as part of that write: the next text out starts a line of
/// its own, and where the failure lost a whole line a blank line stands in its place. Where
/// the line break is refused too, the write it leads is not made, since its text would join
/// the cut line, and the next write tries again.
///
/// <see cref="Program"/>'s Main installs it once, after it sets the code page.
/// Setting <see cref="Console.OutputEncoding"/> replaces a writer the console made for
/// itself and keeps one installed through <see cref="Console.SetOut"/>, so with the code
/// page set first this guard wraps a writer that already writes UTF-8, and putting the
/// code page back at the end leaves it in place.
