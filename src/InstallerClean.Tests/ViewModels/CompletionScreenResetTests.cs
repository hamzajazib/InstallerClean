/// <summary>
/// The rule every public <c>Show*</c> method on <see cref="CompletionViewModel"/> keeps:
/// each one sets every field the completion card reads.
///
/// The view-model instance is reused across operations, so a method that left a field
/// alone would paint the previous run's value under this run's heading: a Move that
/// failed at two files, then a Delete that succeeded, would show the delete's green
/// heading over the move's "2 of 71 could not be moved". Several of the fields say so on
/// their own declaration, in the words "cleared everywhere else, because the view-model
/// instance is reused across operations".
///
/// <c>The_count_line_and_warning_heading_do_not_survive_into_the_next_operation</c> in
/// CompletionViewModelTests holds one transition and two of the fields. This class holds
/// the same rule for every screen and every field.
///
/// Each screen is painted twice rather than checked for an assignment, because an
/// assignment is not observable from outside the object. Reading a field after one call
/// cannot tell an assignment from a field that already held the right value, since a
/// fresh screen's defaults are empty and false and so is most of what these methods
/// write. PropertyChanged cannot tell either: CommunityToolkit's generated setter calls
/// SetProperty, which compares first and raises nothing when the value is unchanged.
///
/// So the same call is made twice with the same arguments, once on a fresh instance and
/// once on an instance whose every field has been set to a value no default holds, and
/// the two screens must come out identical. A field the method does not set keeps the
/// planted value in the second run and not in the first, and the failure names it.
///
/// The methods and the fields are both discovered, so a new screen or a new field is
/// walked without this file changing.
/// <c>The_walk_finds_the_screens_and_the_fields_rather_than_an_empty_set</c> is the
/// control under that, because a discovery that matches nothing makes every assertion
/// here pass over an empty set.
