/// The real <see cref="MutexProbe"/> against real Win32 named mutexes. Covering
/// it separately is what stops <c>FakeMutexProbe</c> being the only thing under
/// test: the fake defines the contract it imitates, so the real probe has to be
/// held to that contract independently. The mutex hold that stops a msiexec
/// racing a delete batch rests entirely on
/// <c>TryAcquire</c> reporting the right <see cref="MutexAcquireOutcome"/>, since
/// DeleteFilesService and MoveFilesService refuse the whole batch and choose which
/// refusal the user is told about on exactly that value.
///
/// A <c>Local\</c> name with a fresh GUID per test, never
/// <c>Global\_MSIExecute</c>: the real object is machine-wide and taking it
/// would serialise every installer on whichever machine ran the suite, which
/// is the very cost the production comment warns about.
///
/// The access-refused answers (<see cref="MutexSample.AccessRefused"/> from the
/// sample, and a null lease with <see cref="MutexAcquireOutcome.AccessRefused"/>
/// from the acquire) are reproduced with a named object whose DACL is empty. Each
/// test using one first shows a plain open of that object being refused with the
/// very call the probe makes, so a setup that went subtly wrong fails there rather
/// than letting the assertion after it pass for the wrong reason.
