/// WHICH PRODUCTS GET ASKED WHETHER THEY ARE A SECOND INSTANCE OF THEMSELVES.
///
/// The reading itself is pinned beside the enumeration's own loop, where the spellings
/// and the failure direction are held. What is here is the OTHER population: a product
/// the machine-wide enumeration lost, which is recovered afterwards by name, asked
/// whether it is installed, asked about every patch it holds, and asked this in its own
/// account and context.
///
/// THAT IS THE POPULATION MOST LIKELY TO HOLD THE CONDITION. The machine this class of
/// work is about is one carrying the same program twice, and the sibling file on the
/// recovered-product condition opens by describing exactly that machine: a copy the
/// sweep does not return and the registry does.
///
/// AND THE PRODUCTS NOTHING SHOWS WERE ASKED. A product the registry names that Windows
/// would not say is installed is never recovered, so it is never put the question, and
/// a registry key whose name yields no code cannot be matched to any product that was.
/// The rule reads both counts, and the last two fixtures are those two states.
///
/// READ WHAT EACH FIXTURE SETS UP. Every one of them differs from its neighbour in a
/// single reading, so a count that moved for any other reason would show up as the
/// wrong pair moving together.
