/// from the enum itself.
///
/// CliPendingRebootStringsTests walks the same enum twice, once per string surface, so
/// a reason added without its sentence or without its label is a red test. The emitter
/// reads the exit code and the entry class off the reason as well, in one expression,
/// and a member it does not name falls to the arm that promises a caller nothing about
/// coming back. So a reason added later still takes both without anybody choosing them,
/// and the two string surfaces give no cover here: a member can carry a sentence and a
/// label and still have had no thought given to what a scheduler should do about it.
///
/// THE TABLE IS THE DECISION AND THE WALK IS THE GATE. One row per reason; a member
/// with no row fails below, and writing its row is the choice being made.
///
/// HOW EACH COLUMN IS HELD. Both are read back from a real run driven through the work
/// method: the exit code it returns, and the class of the one entry it writes, as the
/// suite's recorder receives it. The event class is also held against the exit code
/// declared beside it: its Event ID has to sit in the band that code's entries go out in.
