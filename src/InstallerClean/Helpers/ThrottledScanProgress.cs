/// a line of text and starts an animation, and a name replaced faster than a
/// screen draws is a name nobody reads. Held at the reporting thread, before
/// anything is posted, so what a phase costs to report is the interval rather
/// than its item count.

/// The scan's phases run one after another and never report at once, but each
/// reports from whichever thread it runs on, so the timestamp crosses threads and
