/// Backs the details window's file list. Groups packages by product (so an MSI
/// and its patches show as a single row), sorts alphabetically by product
/// name, and lazy-loads MSI summary metadata for the selected row off the UI
/// thread. The cache survives selection cycles.
///
/// ONE LIST, HOLDING TWO POPULATIONS. The registrations Windows still has a
/// record of, and the files this scan declined to offer. They sat under
/// separate headings until 3.0.0 and now share <see cref="Products"/>, a
/// withheld file arriving as an ordinary row with no product name of its own.
/// The detail pane needs no special case for one, because it reads the FILE
/// rather than the registration: author, title, signing certificate and the
/// rest all come out of the package's own summary stream, which is why the
/// orphaned window can show a certificate for a file no registration claims.
///
/// Rows flag as missing on <c>IsMissingFromDisk</c>, the plain question of
/// whether the file is there. It drives <see cref="ShowMissing"/>, which puts
/// the recovery note in front of the reader, and the window's opening
/// selection. The flag grades no patch state and must not start: Windows opens
/// every registered patch's cached file whatever state it carries, so an absent
/// file is the same condition on a superseded registration as on any other.
///
/// WHICH REGISTRATIONS REACH THAT FLAG IS SETTLED BEFORE ANY ROW IS BUILT, at
/// the head of the constructor, and it is the narrower question of whether
/// anything could still reach for the file. The two are separate on purpose:
/// the flag describes a row, and the filter decides whether there is one.
///
/// THIS IS WHERE THE PROGRAMS ARE NAMED. The main window's line says how many
/// files and names the first few; this window has room for all of them, which is
/// what "Open Details for what to do" is sending the reader to.
